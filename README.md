## About me:

My name is Brian Pipa and I'm a code monkey, a geek, a husband, a dad, and a gamer (but not necessarily in that order). Some info about me:
* I have been coding for over 25 years, mostly in Java, but also in Ruby on Rails.
* I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan. I even own https://myvogonpoetry.com where I sometimes write in my blog
* I used to get paid to review PC games. I wrote for Avault, VoodoExtreme,Gamesmania, etc. I had some of my review quotes on PC game boxes and I even went to E3 as a member of the press!
* If you feel the need to email me, my email address is on gmail.com and the user name is my firstnamelastname.

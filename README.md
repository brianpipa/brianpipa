## About me:

My name is Brian Pipa and I'm a code monkey, a geek, a husband, a dad, and a gamer (but not necessarily in that order). Some info about me:
* I have been coding for over 25 years, mostly in Java.
* I co-founded a company called Brainy Atom, LLC in 2006 where I wrote Ruby on Rails code for our sites like Teenormous. I sold my half of the company in 2012.
* I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan. I even own two domains (http://myvogonpoetry.com and http://gruntbug.com) that are references to his work.
* Sometimes I ramble at my blog - http://myvogonpoetry.com.

My list of side coding projects/websites:
* My "just for fun" coding projects are tracked at http://pipasoft.com.
* My public github projects: https://github.com/brianpipa?tab=repositories
* In 2023 I launched http://overreader.com to search for your Goodreads books on Overdrive/Libby and on Kindle Unlimited
* In 2022 I created http://customizercorner.com to aggregate action figure customizer sites and products.
* In 2008 I Launched http://geekcrafts.com - a blog about... geek crafts
* In 2005 I started a candy blog called Candy Addict at http://candyaddit.com and at one point it was ranked on the front page of Google when searching for candy. It's pretty much dead now, but was a fun ride.
* My resume is online at http://brianpipa.com/misc/resume/ . I'm always willing to entertain Java opportunities.
* If you feel the need to email me, you can email me at http://brianpipa.com I'll let you figure out the email address (HINT: brian).
